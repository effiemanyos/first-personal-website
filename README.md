## **1.3. Structure Plane** 

The current structure of the website is the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|CONTACT|
|--|----|-----|---|---|
|About Me |G3|DSJJH|DSJJH|
|How Can I Help|G3|DSJJH|DSJJH|
|What I Do|G3|DSJJH|DSJJH|
|Testimonials|G3|DSJJH|DSJJH|
|Contact Me|G3|DSJJH|DSJJH|
|Footer|G3|DSJJH|DSJJH|

At the moment, the website consists in only one page containing various sections shown one under the other.

The **intended structure** of the website for the **MVP** was the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|CONTACT|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|About Me |About Me|How Can I Help (*)|DSJJH||---|
|How Can I Help (*)|Expertise|What I Do (**)|DSJJH|
|What I Do (**)|Work Experience|Digital Marketing|DSJJH|
|Testimonials|Qualifications|Product Management|DSJJH|
|SECTION|Hard Skills|Entrepreneurship|DSJJH|
|Contact Me|Contact Me|Contact Me|DSJJH|
|Footer|Footer|Footer|DSJJH|

(*) Services Types
(**) Services Fields

Unfortunately, the **scope** had to be reduced and adjusted due to the lack of resources, which the most important was **time**, and then **knowledge** to develop some sections and complex features.

The sections that will be added in the near future are the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|CONTACT|
|--|----|-----|---|---|

### **Colours**

According to an article on **[The Science of Colour Persuasion](https://idealogicbrandlab.com/color-persuasion/)** by **IDealogic® Brand Lab**:

Colour establishes **brand recognition** amongst consumers, therefore it is crucial that the same colours are always used across all channels, such as website, social media, advertising, product packaging, merchandising, etc.

The following are the colours used for this project:

![the website and brand colour palette](./assets/images/color-scheme.png "the website and brand colour palette")

**Primary Colours:**
> - **Purple** → Associated with **wisdom, wealth, spirituality, imaginative, and sophistication**.
> - **Black** → Associated with **sophistication, luxury, security, power, elegance, authority, and substance**.
> - **Green** → Associated with **health, tranquility, growth, freshness, prosperity, hope, balance, harmony, and nature**.
> - **Pink** → Associated with femininity. **Imaginative, passionate, caring, creativity, innovative, quirky**. 

### **Imagery**

Illustrations from **[UnDraw](https://undraw.co/)** have been used to improve the UX. These illustrations have been modified to match the website and brand colours.

When ready, professional photos will be added to the website in various sections. Some of the images will come from:
- Workshops
- Events
- Webinars
- Collaborations

At the moment, the imagery used is for academic purposes to meet the project deadline. These images will be replaced before the launch of the website.
