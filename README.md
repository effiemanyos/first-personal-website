## **1.3. Structure Plane** 

The current structure of the website is the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|TESTIMONIALS|CONTACT|
|--|----|-----|---|---|---|
|Hero Image |About Me|How Can I Help|Learning Hub|Testimonials|Contact Me|
||Communities|What I Do||||
||Work Experience|||||
||Qualifications|||||

> Besides the 'Footer' section, which goes after the 'Contact Me' section.

At the moment, the website consists in only one page containing various sections shown one under the other.

The **intended structure** of the website for the **MVP** was the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|RESOURCES|JOIN US|CONTACT|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Hero Image √ |About Me √|How Can I Help (*) √|Learning Hub √|Recommend Resources (^) √|Memberships X|Contact Me √|
|About Me √|Expertise #|What I Do (**) √|Workshops & Webinars X|Books & eBooks X|Join Huasi X|Footer √|
|How Can I Help (*) √|Work Experience √|Digital Marketing √|Online Courses X|Blogs & Newsletters X|Join NetCork X||
|What I Do (**) √|Qualifications √|Product Management √|1:1 & Group Sessions X|Podcasts & Clubhouse X|P&C X||
|Testimonials √|Top Skills √|Entrepreneurship X|Podcast & YouTube X|PPL/SM/YT Channels X| Contact Me √||

|Footer √|Footer √|Footer √|Footer √|Footer √||

>(*) Services types  
(**) Services fields  
(^) Summary of all the recommended types of resources 

Unfortunately, the **scope** had to be reduced and adjusted due to the lack of resources, which the most important was **time**, and then **knowledge** to develop some sections and complex features.

The sections that will be added in the near future are the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|RESOURCES|JOIN US|CONTACT|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Welcome Video (#)|Side Projects|Entrepreneurship|Workshops & Webinars|Books & eBooks|Memberships|Book a Call (**)|
|Featured In (*)|Volunteering|Recommended Partners|Online Courses|Blogs & Newsletters|Join Huasi||
|Key Figures||Case Studies (Clients)|1:1 & Group Sessions|Podcasts & Clubhouse|Join NetCork||

|Clients|||Blog & Newsletter|Free/Cheap Tools||
||||Virtual Meetups|Other Resources (^)||

> (#) Welcome Video or Hero Video   
(*) 'Featured In' or 'Partners' section  
(**) [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) integration so that users can **book free consultations** without having to send an email or a message.     
(^) Communities, White Papers, Toolkits, Guides, Templates, Frameworks, Networking, Volunteering, Cheat Sheets, Infographics, Events, etc.    

Besides these sections, a **login/logout** feature will be implemented in the navigation bar so that users can access exclusive content provided to their chosen membership plan.    

This will also require the implementation of a feature that allows users to make **payments online** for their prefered subscription plan on a monthly or annually basis.

### **Wireframes**

- **Tablet**
- **Desktop**

## **1.5. Surface Plane** 

### **Typography**

Only two fonts were used for this project.

- **[Neucha](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Neucha?query=Neucha&preview.text_type=custom)**, designed by Jovanny Lemonad, for all titles and subtitles.  
- **[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins&preview.text_type=custom)**, designed by Indian Type Foundry, Jonny Pinhorn, for all paragraphs.

**Font Sizes:**

The following styling has been used for consistency and alignment throughout the entire website:
- **Titles (h1, h2):** 

```CSS
/* Main Titles Styling */
.titles {
    font-family: Neucha, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 40px;
    letter-spacing: 4px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
}
```

- **Subtitles (h3, h4):**

```CSS
/* Subtitles Styling */
.subtitles {
    font-family: Neucha, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 25px;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
}
```

- **Paragraphs (p):**

```CSS
/* Paragraphs Styling */
.paragraphs {
    font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
}
```

### **Colours**

According to an article on **[The Science of Colour Persuasion](https://idealogicbrandlab.com/color-persuasion/)** by **IDealogic® Brand Lab**:

Colour establishes **brand recognition** amongst consumers, therefore it is crucial that the same colours are always used across all channels, such as website, social media, advertising, product packaging, merchandising, etc.

The following are the colours used for this project:

![the website and brand colour palette](./assets/images/color-scheme.png "the website and brand colour palette")

**Primary Colours:**
> - **Purple** → Associated with **wisdom, wealth, spirituality, imaginative, and sophistication**.
> - **Black** → Associated with **sophistication, luxury, security, power, elegance, authority, and substance**.
> - **Green** → Associated with **health, tranquility, growth, freshness, prosperity, hope, balance, harmony, and nature**.
> - **Pink** → Associated with femininity. **Imaginative, passionate, caring, creativity, innovative, quirky**. 

### **Imagery**

Illustrations from **[UnDraw](https://undraw.co/)** have been used to improve the UX. These illustrations have been modified to match the website and brand colours.

Professional photographies from **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)** have been used to represent the owner's origins. All the selected images, except for the hero image, were taken in Peru, South America.

When ready, professional photos will be added to the website in various sections. Some of the images will come from:
- Workshops
- Events
- Webinars
- Collaborations
- Volunteering
- Owner's Promotional Photos

At the moment, the imagery used is for academic purposes only in order to meet the project deadline. These images will be replaced before the launch of the website.
